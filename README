Experiment in Semi-manual binding between C++ and Lua.

Basically make the boring slightly difficult stuff easier, and leaving the more fun
not so hard stuff to do. :-)

The memory management, life-cycle, and method despatch is the same for each
bound class, only the glue functions that marshal the parameters are
different.

Hand writing the glue functions also allows them to be as complicated or as
simple as required.  For example you could support optional arguments, or even
overloading.

Shared pointers are used to simplify the question of who owns what, and who
should delete it. Class instances can be created in Lua or C++ and passed to
the other freely, as the last one holding a reference will call the
destructor when required.
